1. Identify your thoughts and understand what's actually going on with yourself and your thought process.
  
2. If you are doing something or taking some action which could harm you in long run or derail you from your precious goal say it yourself as a third person watching you ***"oh, how intersting that they would do such a thing"*** if you need some extra help point out and calling them in your real life ***"I'm not going to do that k knowing which would harm me in long run"*** -> it add's weight to your point than rather slip into boring routine.

3. This technique work's good in remembering the "To do List" by saying "I need to complete this book after my routine"

***The Pointing and Calling and Habit Scorecard are focused on getting you recoginze tha habits and acknowledge the cues that trigger them, which makes easy for you to respond in a way which will benifit you***
